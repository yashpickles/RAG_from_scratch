Repository Description for RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) from Scratch
RAG-from-Scratch
A lightweight and framework-free implementation of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

This repository demonstrates how to build a complete RAG system from the ground up, without relying on pre-built frameworks like LangChain or Haystack. It is designed to help developers, researchers, and enthusiasts gain a deeper understanding of the components and workflow of RAG systems by implementing them step-by-step in Python.

Features:
Custom Retriever:

Implementation of a vector-based retrieval system using FAISS or a custom similarity search algorithm.
Option to use TF-IDF or dense embeddings generated via a pretrained transformer model for document indexing.
Knowledge Store:

Store and manage documents using a simple file system or a database.
Efficient storage of embeddings for fast retrieval.
Custom Generation Model:

Integration with OpenAI GPT or any Hugging Face transformer model for generating responses based on retrieved context.
Implementation of input preprocessing and context concatenation for optimal response quality.
End-to-End Pipeline:

Query processing → Document retrieval → Context preparation → Text generation.
No external frameworks; built entirely with Python and essential libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and PyTorch.
Minimal Dependencies:

Focus on simplicity and clarity by keeping the code lightweight and easy to understand.
Key libraries used include FAISS (optional), Hugging Face Transformers (optional), and Scikit-learn.
Why This Repository?
While frameworks provide convenience, they often abstract away key implementation details. This repository is ideal for:

Learning the core concepts behind RAG.
Customizing components to suit unique use cases.
Deploying a minimal RAG system without unnecessary dependencies.
